# E-commerce-server
**This is the server-side repo for the E-commerce shopping project.**

The API's were built on [Graphql](graphql.org). Graphql is a query language api that enables client application to define the query that the server application returns
the data as requested. 

The data was stored on MongoDB. I chose MongoDB due to its flexibility when defining schemas.

The following resolvers were implemented here:
 - Function to register and login users.
 - Function to add product and remove them from database.
 - Function to create cart for new users.
 - Function to add and remove products from cart.
 - Function to checkout products.

The server application was hosted on [heroku](heroku.com).
